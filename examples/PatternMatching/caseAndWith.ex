# If itâ€™s necessary to match against multiple patterns we can use `case/2`

# if ok and something print that something
# else print error

# >> "Hello World"

case :even do

# Another neat feature of case/2 is its support for guard clauses

# The special form `with/1` is useful when you might use a nested `case/2`
# statement or situations that cannot cleanly be piped together.
# The `with/1` expression is composed of the keywords, the generators, and finally an expression.
