# Elixir Tutorial - Group 3

This repository contains support files for the presentation of the *Elixir* programming language in the CSLP class.

## Installation

### Compiler/Interpreter

Refer to the [Elixir Installation Guide](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) for installation instructions for your operating system.

Installing through the official guide includes the following:
- `elixirc`: compiler
- `elixir`: interpreter
- `iex`: interactive interpreter
- `mix`: bundler/dependency manager


### IDE

The recommended IDE is `vs-code`, but you can develop with any text editor.

If you use `vs-code`, install [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JakeBecker.elixir-ls) to get many helpful features.

**Note**: if you are using WSL, this extension may be broken. If you want features such as autocompletion, documentation on hover, and others, use Windows instead.


## Examples 

The folder `/examples` contains examples about different topics of the language.

These are supposed to serve as support for understanding concepts that are used to solve exercises.


## Exercises

The folder `/exercises` contains exercises about different topics of the language.

It includes boilerplate with some missing code to complete them.
